# discordMusicBot
Discord voice channel music bot

Replace 'TOKEN' in .env with your bot's token

I suggest having a main folder, in which the FFmpeg download folder, musicbot.py, and an empty folder labeled downloaded are all placed. 

FFmpeg: https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html

NOTE: This bot will only work in one voice channel in one server at a time. Errors will occour otherwise.

For a user to use !fullskip, they must be an admin or have a role titled 'DJ'

Known issues: The first song that plays will begin off-speed (usually faster) and rarely songs will cut off early
