Discord voice channel music bot

I suggest having a main folder, in which the FFmpeg download folder, musicbot.py, and an empty folder labeled downloaded are all placed.

FFmpeg: https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html

NOTE: This bot will only work in one voice channel in one server at a time. Errors will occour otherwise.

Known issues:
-The first song that plays will begin off-speed (usually quick)
-Rarely songs will cut off early
